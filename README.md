# Integrating-PL-0-Compiler
The code provided is an implementation of a compiler for a simple programming language called PL/0. The PL/0 language is a procedural language that supports variables, constants, arithmetic and logical operations, and control structures like conditional statements and loops.

The compiler implemented in the code takes source code written in PL/0 as input and generates machine code that can be executed by a computer. The compiler consists of several phases, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation.

In the lexical analysis phase, the input source code is broken down into a sequence of tokens, each representing a keyword, identifier, operator, or literal value. The syntax analysis phase then checks that the tokens form a valid program according to the grammar rules of PL/0.

After the syntax analysis phase, the semantic analysis phase checks the validity of the program's semantics. This includes ensuring that variables are declared before they are used and that they are of the correct type.

Finally, in the code generation phase, the compiler generates machine code that corresponds to the PL/0 program. The resulting code can be executed on a computer, either directly or after being assembled and linked with other programs.

Overall, this PL/0 compiler implementation provides a basic but functional example of how a compiler works, taking high-level source code and transforming it into machine code that can be executed on a computer.
